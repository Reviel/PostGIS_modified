Project Description
==============================================================================
This Project is a modification based on PostGIS-3.4.1, retaining only the 
source code of liblwgeom and raster. The original build method has been 
abandoned, and CMake has been made to the introduced source code.

The following modifications are involved:

1. Removal of the static keyword: The static keyword has been removed from 
functions like gserialized2_from_lwgeom_any.

2. Memory copy for point collections: References to point collections in 
functions like lwgeom_from_gserialized2_buffer have been changed to memory 
copies to better handle multithreading and custom memory.

3. Introduction of new structures: A new structure LWGEOM_CONTEXT has been 
added, along with lwcontext functions and other macros and structures. 
Original global variables such as tflags, lwgeom_geos_errmsg, pj_ctx, 
variables and functions used for parsing WKT, and parameters like geos_ctx 
required for calling thread-safe GEOS functions have been moved into this 
structure, and all related references have been modified.

4. Reentrancy support: PostGIS was originally designed for PostgreSQL's
multi-process architecture, without full consideration for thread safety. 
To adapt to multi-thread environments, we have modified certain functions 
to be reentrant.

5. Custom JSON memory handing: The function lwgeom_set_json_handlers has been 
added to allow for custom memory management when calling the JSON library.

6. Support for GML curve types: Some functions have been modified to support 
parsing curve types in GML.

7. New functions: New functions such as option_list_geos_parse have been added.

8. Version information: A function to output version information has been added 
to librt_core.so.

9. Bug fixes and error detection: Some bugs have been fixed, and additional 
checks have been added to detect potential errors.

10. Code simplification: Based on the original PostGIS codebase, only selected portions of the liblwgeom and raster modules have been retained.

11. Removed the original compilation scripts and build methods, and adopted 
CMake for building.
